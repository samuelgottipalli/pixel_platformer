## üèóÔ∏è Boss Level Design

### Boss Arena Template:

```python
boss_arena = {
    'width': 1280,  # Single screen
    'height': 720,
    'theme': 'SCIFI',  # Match act theme
    'spawn_x': 200,  # Player start
    'spawn_y': 500,
    'time_limit': 'none',  # No time limit
    'tiles': [
        # Floor
        *[{'x': i * 32, 'y': 640, 'solid': True} for i in range(40)],
        # Walls (prevent escape)
        *[{'x': 0, 'y': i * 32, 'solid': True} for i in range(22)],
        *[{'x': 1248, 'y': i * 32, 'solid': True} for i in range(22)],
        # Small platforms for mobility
        {'x': 200, 'y': 500, 'solid': True},
        {'x': 1000, 'y': 500, 'solid': True},
        {'x': 600, 'y': 400, 'solid': True},
    ],
    'enemies': [],  # Boss spawns automatically
    'hazards': [],  # Optional arena hazards
    'coins': [],
    'powerups': [
        # Health pickups in corners
        {'x': 200, 'y': 460, 'type': 'health'},
        {'x': 1000, 'y': 460, 'type': 'health'},
    ],
    'keys': [],
    'portals': []  # Spawns on boss defeat
}
```

### Boss Arena Design Tips:

**Good Arena:**
- ‚úÖ Single screen (1280x720)
- ‚úÖ Small platforms for mobility
- ‚úÖ Walls to prevent escape
- ‚úÖ Health pickups in corners
- ‚úÖ Clear floor space
- ‚úÖ Vertical room for attacks

**Bad Arena:**
- ‚ùå Too cramped
- ‚ùå Too open (player can run away)
- ‚ùå Platforms block boss visibility
- ‚ùå Hazards too dangerous
- ‚ùå No health pickups

---

## üéØ Boss Spawn System

### Automatic Boss Spawning:

Bosses spawn automatically on these levels:
- **Level 6:** Guardian (Act 1 boss)
- **Level 12:** Forest Guardian (Act 2 boss)
- **Level 18:** Void Sentinel (Act 3 boss)
- **Level 24:** Ancient Evil (Final boss)

**How it works:**
```python
# In _check_and_spawn_boss():
boss_levels = {
    6: 'guardian',
    12: 'forest',
    18: 'void',
    24: 'ancient'
}

if current_level_index in boss_levels:
    boss = Boss(x, y, boss_type, difficulty)
```

### Manual Boss Spawning:

If you want a boss on a different level:

```python
from entities.boss import Boss

# Spawn custom boss
self.boss = Boss(
    x=640,  # Center screen
    y=100,  # Top of screen
    boss_type='guardian',  # or forest, void, ancient
    difficulty=self.difficulty
)
self.boss_defeated = False
```
